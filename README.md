# FunctionTest
This is just a simple Azure function to test deployment processes from GitHub Actions.  

## QRCoder
Once I had the function deploying, I figured a simple implementation of the very good QRCoder library would be useful.

## Fluent Validation
Once I had incoming data, I figured that I had better start validating the data.  Found a great article here https://www.tomfaltesek.com/azure-functions-input-validation/ that made it all clear.  This seemed like a nice middle ground to remove a lot of boiler plate validation without using a full "clean" approach like I would in a Web API project.  I feel like adding a lot of DI would ake this more complex than the "spirit" of Azure Functions.  Could be wildly wrong and just not know it yet.
